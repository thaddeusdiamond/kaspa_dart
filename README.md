## Kaspa dart sdk, thanks to  https://github.com/aspectron/kaspa-wallet and https://github.com/azbuky/kaspium_wallet




before run test, add `config.dart` file under tests folder and put value

```dart

const testWordsFiscal = "your words";
const testToAddress = "your toAddress";
// query from 
// https://api.kaspa.org/addresses/$address/utxos
// choose needed utxo for test
const utxoJsonString = '[{},{}]'
;

```
